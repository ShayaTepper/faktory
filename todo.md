# To do

- Add Eloquent dependency (maybe not hard dependency) and setup some functional tests that specify an in-memory database connection and migrate some test schemas directly in the tests so I can actually include them in the package, instead of just running tests in a sample project like I am now
- Add documentation on hasMany, belongsTo and hasOne
